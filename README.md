# Hi everyone!

I am Marilou, a student doing mostly mathematics and computer science from France 🇫🇷

## My school projects:

* [My TIPE for the year 2024](https://github.com/marilabs/tipe-2024), a school project made during my years in prépa at the lycée Charlemagne (🐍, 🦀)
* My TIPE for the year 2023 (not yet available in public), (🐍, 🐫)

## My personal projects:

* [Trying to get better in CS!](https://github.com/marilabs/training-algo), some problems from various sources to practice famous algorthims or data structures
* quantum-tasks, a task manager (that remains private for now)

## What I do with others:

I mostly design logos for others, mostly
